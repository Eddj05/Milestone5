**Abstract:**

In this project I will do research about ‘World Englishes’. Specifically about the differences in American English and British English. Over the years American English has become more popular, while British English is the root of all the ‘World Englishes’. I want to figure out whether there is a link between the preferred English variant in countries. A lot of countries might have been Americanised since the country with the main focus. But there might still be countries which heavily rely on the British English variant.

-  This paper looks into the differences of British and American English, but it is also about the history of these languages. For example: since when did American English become popular etc.

-  This paper looks into European education, it explains arguments on why to use American English over British English (or not) in teaching.

**Research question:**

Is There a relation between the preferred ‘World English’ and where it is spoken?

Variables: 

-  The preferred ‘World English’

-  The country where it is spoken. (more specifically explained in methods)

**Hypothesis:**
In different countries, there is a preference for a different variant of English. (so one is used more frequently than the other)

**Method:**

I want to solve this question in Google N-Grams. In here there’s options to search through literature of different countries. So I will try to find trends in literature of different European countries which are available. Specifically: German, French and Italian. With this I want to find out whether these countries use more British English or American English.
