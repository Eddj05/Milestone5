# Milestone 5, Edwin de Jong
**Abstract:**

In this project I will do research about ‘World Englishes’. Specifically about the use of 'American English in the 'British English' language. Over the years American English has become more popular, while British English is the root of all the ‘World Englishes’. I want to figure out whether there is a correlation between the growth of 'American English' and the use of 'American English' in 'British English'. In other words, are americanised english words used in British English. A lot of countries might have been Americanised since it has become the main focused country, however is this also the case for England.

**Previous work:**

Abu Fares, A. A. F. M. (2019). British English and American English: History and Differences. International Journal of Linguistics, Literature and Translation, 2(1), 105–116. https://doi.org/10.32996/ijllt.2019.2.1.14x

-  This paper looks into the differences of British and American English, but it is also about the history of these languages. For example: since when did American English become popular etc.

Tomović, N. (2022). THE PLACE OF AMERICAN ENGLISH IN EUROPEAN EDUCATION. Komunikacija I Kultura Online, 13(13), 195-205. doi:10.18485/kkonline.2022.13.13.12

-  This paper looks into European education, it explains arguments on why to use American English over British English (or not) in teaching.

**Research question:**

Is there a relation between the preferred ‘World English’ and where it is spoken?

Variables: 

-  The preferred ‘World English’

-  The country where it is spoken. (more specifically explained in methods)

**Hypothesis:**
In different countries, there is a preference for a different variant of English. (so one is used more frequently than the other)

**Method:**

I want to solve this question in Google N-Grams. In here there’s options to search through literature of different countries. So I will try to find trends in literature of different European countries which are available. Specifically: German, French and Italian. With this I want to find out whether these countries use more British English or American English.
